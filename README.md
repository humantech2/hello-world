# hello-world
Just another repository
=======================

Hello,

James (HumanTech2) here. I like learning java, javascript, node.js, arduino, and other things like that.
My interests are automation, drones, robots, and bringing sci-fi to life.
My goals are self-development, learning new skills and bridging knowledge gaps to work on new projects.
My favorite color is orange and I want to make a difference in the world. 

Thanks for reading, humans!
